## **Experience**

### **Machine Learning Research Assistant**  
**KU Leuven — Faculty of Engineering Science**  
*2024 – Present*

- Designed, trained, and evaluated **YOLO-based object detection systems** for plastic-sorting under severe domain shift.  
- Built an **end-to-end vision data infrastructure**: AWS S3, UID-based metadata registries (Polars/DuckDB), deterministic data ingestion, and automated cropping pipelines.  
- Produced and curated a **large multi-class dataset** (PE, PP, PS, ABS, PVC) using Label-Studio with custom OBB exporters and batch-inference tools.  
- Developed a **PyTorch classifier** with colour-invariant augmentation, domain-balanced sampling, and modular configuration.  
- Containerised camera I/O, detection, cropping, and classification pipelines using **Docker**, enabling reproducible experiments.  
- Set up robust internal tooling for dataset growth, reproducibility, and faculty-wide use.

### **Senior Associate — Risk & Treasury Consulting**  
**KPMG GmbH (Frankfurt)**  
*03.2024 – 10.2024*

- Drafted the complete **IRRBB modelling review** for the ECB inspection of State Street Bank Germany (EVE/NII).  
- Contributed to a bank-wide **Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP)** design, including behavioural modelling and balance-sheet segmentation.  
- Built a **VBA-based FX exposure tool** used by consultants to identify mismatches and basis-risk hotspots.

### **Supervisory Analyst — Banking Supervision**  
**European Central Bank (DG-OMI)**  
*09.2021 – 09.2023*

- Built Python/SQL/Tableau/GitLab pipelines automating inspection-support processes; reduced reporting delays by **80%+**.  
- Developed an internal **inspection-findings dashboard** and analytics workflows reused across missions.  
- Implemented a **NLP prototype** (Regex, TF-IDF, tokenisation) to extract findings from supervisory documents.  
- Contributed to IRRBB on-site inspections, submitting a documented finding on IT reporting infrastructure.
