## **Experience**

### **Machine Learning Research Assistant**
**KU Leuven – Faculty of Engineering Science (Chem & Tech)**  
*2024 – Present*

- Designed and trained a **YOLO-based object detection model** to locate plastic items in heterogeneous imaging conditions (industrial conveyor vs lab setups), including dataset construction, annotation workflows, and evaluation.
- Developed a **plastic-type classification model** using cropped ROIs from the detector, focusing on robustness across domains and practical constraints of real-world sorting environments.
- Built an **end-to-end prototype system** integrating detection → cropping → classification, packaged into modular Docker services for reproducible deployment and internal faculty testing.
- Established reusable **ML data infrastructure**, enabling scalable experiments and clean dataset growth for the research group.

### **Senior Associate — Risk & Treasury Consulting**  
**KPMG GmbH (Frankfurt)**  
*03.2024 – 10.2024*

- Drafted the complete **IRRBB modelling review** for the ECB inspection of State Street Bank Germany (EVE/NII).  
- Contributed to a bank-wide **Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP)** design, including behavioural modelling and balance-sheet segmentation.  
- Built a **VBA-based FX exposure tool** used by consultants to identify mismatches and basis-risk hotspots.

---

### **Supervisory Analyst — Banking Supervision**  
**European Central Bank (DG-OMI)**  
*09.2021 – 09.2023*

- Built Python/SQL/Tableau/GitLab pipelines automating inspection-support processes; reduced reporting delays by **80%+**.  
- Developed an internal **inspection-findings dashboard** and analytics workflows reused across missions.  
- Implemented a **NLP prototype** (Regex, TF-IDF, tokenisation) to extract findings from supervisory documents.  
- Contributed to IRRBB on-site inspections, submitting a documented finding on IT reporting infrastructure.
